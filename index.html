                        <h2>WellStar Broke New Ground In Many Ways This Year</h2>
                        <p>We grew bigger, yes, but most importantly, better. More dedicated to meeting the needs of the 1.4 million people we serve. More committed to innovation and partnerships that help us provide world-class healthcare close to home.
                        <br><br>Our most visible achievement was opening the replacement WellStar Paulding Hospital, a bright, healing environment where cutting-edge technology enhances patient safety and reduces environmental impact.
                        <br><br>The new WellStar Pediatric Center offers high-quality, child-centered services with convenient hours and pediatric specialists on site. From the doctors to the design, it is solely dedicated to the well-being of children.
                        <br><br>Our second Health Park, in East Cobb, opened its doors in September, a single source of urgent and primary care and other specialty services in an easy-to-access neighborhood setting. In response to the success of the Acworth and East Cobb locations, we’re bringing Health Parks to Cherokee County and Vinings.
                        <br><br>In some cases “groundbreaking” did not result in new buildings, but in valuable new partnerships. WellStar has partnered with Piedmont Healthcare to create a new insurance company, called Piedmont WellStar HealthPlans. The plans feature disease prevention and affordable care management for members of the community and for team members of both health systems. As a member of the Mayo Clinic Care Network, WellStar physicians have the ability to consult with Mayo specialists, bringing extraordinary medical insight to complex cases at no cost to our patients. We earned a place on the FORTUNE 100 Best Companies to Work For® list. And, through our Epic® system, WellStar Connect, we advanced our capability in electronic medical recordkeeping with the goal of better care through more efficient communication.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p><br>Our System took an important step toward building our future with the announcement that President and Chief Operating Officer Candice Saunders will become WellStar President and CEO in January 2016.
                        <br><br>The result of all these efforts is a community that grows healthier one neighbor at a time. In the pages that follow, you’ll meet one of those neighbors and learn how WellStar helped change the course of a life.
                        <br><br>As an employer of more than 13,000, we boosted the health of our economy as well this year. A strong balance sheet and a robust Foundation permit us to reinvest every dollar into our mission. We will continue to thoughtfully address challenges wherever they arise, never forgetting our mission—to deliver world-class care that makes our community a healthier, better place to live. 
                        <br><br>With your support we look forward to breaking more new ground in the future.
                        <br><br>In good health and gratitude,</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>In February 2014 WellStar Health System joined the prestigious Mayo Clinic Care Network. The arrangement gives WellStar physicians the ability to consult with Mayo specialists, bringing top medical insight to complex medical cases at no cost to our patients. WellStar is the largest member of the Mayo Clinic Care Network in the southeast and the only member in metro Atlanta.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Physicians from WellStar and Mayo Clinic use a digital technology tool known as eConsult to work together and share the latest medical information. The collaboration saves metro Atlanta patients time, money and travel while providing expertise from leading medical specialists.
                        <br><br>A web-based knowledge resource called AskMayoExpert is a state-of-the-art tool that offers access to Mayo Clinic’s knowledge in disease management, clinical care guidelines, treatment recommendations and reference materials for a variety of medical conditions.</p>
                        <p>Most of the collaboration to date has been around complex cancer cases. WellStar patients have also benefited from Mayo expertise in cardiology, neurology, pediatrics and other specialties.
						<br><br>WellStar CEO Reynold Jennings noted, “By working with Mayo, we are transforming healthcare in Northwest Georgia and metro Atlanta and furthering our mission of providing work-class healthcare.”</p>

                        <p>At midnight on April 1, 2014, WellStar Paulding Hospital went dark for the first time since its opening in 1958. At the same moment, the new WellStar Paulding Hospital whirred to life, bringing world-class healthcare to one of Georgia’s fastest-growing communities.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>WellStar Paulding is not only the newest hospital in the Atlanta area, it also incorporates innovative design to maximize patient healing, family comfort and the safety of all who work, visit and are treated there.
                        <br><br>Located in Hiram, the hospital opened with 56 beds and the capacity to expand to 112. There are four surgical suites and 40 emergency exam rooms, plus a dedicated Pediatric Emergency Department. The hospital brought 500 new jobs to the community.</p>

                        <p>Behind the warm lighting and comfortable décor is cutting-edge technology, some of it unique to the Atlanta area. In place of the traditional central nursing stations, caregivers work close to patient rooms. Medical staff wear tiny electronic chips that track handwashing. And germ-fighting UV light air handlers filter the air as it enters the building. A high-efficiency geothermal heat pump system is expected to save 30 percent in energy costs.</p>

                        <p>The welcoming crowd of over 10,000 on hand for the opening celebration reflected the depth of community support for the new hospital. Those present included relatives of the founders of the original Paulding Hospital, a testament to the continuity of our mission. Many in the community have expressed support through their generous donations to name spaces at the new WellStar Paulding Hospital, in honor of the lives of loved ones.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>At WellStar Kennestone Hospital, it’s been a year of innovation and recognition in cardiac care. The hospital was honored with Consumer Reports’ highest rating for coronary artery bypass surgery. Kennestone was the only Georgia hospital to receive that distinction. The hospital also received an STS “3-star Quality” rating out of a possible 3 stars for our CABG surgery.</p>
                        <div class="video-container" onclick="showNotificationArea();">

                        </div>
                        <p>This year also marked the 100th TAVR procedure performed at Kennestone. TAVR is a minimally invasive surgical procedure to repair, rather than replace, damaged aortic valves. The procedure is for patients considered at high-risk for traditional valve replacement. The replacement expands once in place and actually moves the damaged valve out of the way.
                        <br><br>Finally this year, Kennestone became the only hospital in Georgia offering the Convergent Approach for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat). Two specialists, a cardiac surgeon and an electrophysiologist, simultaneously perform this minimally invasive procedure.
                        <br><br>Without a chest incision, the surgeon uses focused heat (radio frequency) to produce scar tissue on the heart that blocks abnormal electrical signals. The electrophysiologist confirms that the abnormal electrical signals have been interrupted and ablates the pulmonary veins within the heart, therefore, converging on the abnormal tissue.</p>

                        <p>Children are not small adults. They need specialized healthcare that meets their physical and emotional needs. The WellStar Pediatric Center in Kennesaw, which opened July 7, offers high-quality, child-centered services with convenient hours and pediatric specialists on site.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The center makes life easier for families in Northwest Georgia who in the past have had to travel long distances for pediatric care. The Pediatric Center gives them access to quality healthcare and a wide range of services close to home.</p>

                        <p>Visitors of all ages appreciate the child-friendly surroundings and nautical theme, prompt appointments and quick lab results. Specialists include radiologists, pediatricians and physical therapists. Trained support staff help guide patients and parents through testing and procedures. Other convenient features include imaging tests, sports injury rehabilitation and after-hours care.</p>

                        <p>Youngsters enjoy playing with kid-friendly technology including an interactive fish tank wall in the waiting room. A child-sized CT, known as a “kitten scanner,” helps alleviate their fear of medical tests by allowing them to “scan” an alligator, a robot and other toys. A soothing nautical theme, music and natural light also help keep things calm. 
                        <br><br>The WellStar Pediatric Center is located at 1180 Barrett Parkway NW and is open seven days a week.</p>

                        <p>The three-story, 162,000-square-foot building houses primary and specialty physician offices as well as urgent care, laboratory services, rehabilitation therapy, a retail pharmacy and a café.  An outpatient surgery center is expected to open in mid-2015. 
                        <br><br>
                        Among physician specialties at the park are family medicine; ear, nose and throat; pediatrics; asthma and allergy; urology; neurosurgery; geriatrics; pain management; orthopedics and chiropractic care.</p>

                        <p>Patients praise the easy parking, welcoming environment and access to onsite testing and imaging. Physicians appreciate the opportunity to improve care by collaborating with other doctors. The East Cobb Community provided valuable input and suggestions throughout the planning process.
                        <br><br>
                        With outpatient care expected to grow more than 30 percent over the next five years, WellStar is committed to delivering quality healthcare where patients live and work. This is the second WellStar Health Park; the first opened in 2012 in Acworth.</p>

                        <p>Children are not small adults. They need specialized healthcare that meets their physical and emotional needs. The new WellStar Pediatric Center in Kennesaw provides just that, with innovative services intended to ensure that our children receive the care they need to enjoy long, productive lives.

Child-friendly surroundings, prompt appointments, pediatric imaging and quick lab results make the center an essential community resource.</p>
                        <h3>More Care for More Patients</h3>
                        <p>WellStar Douglas Hospital moved into an expanded critical care services and intensive care unit, doubling ICU capacity. The project also included renovation and expansion of the hospital’s Emergency Department and added seven private rooms. The result is quicker, better care for the people of Douglas County and surrounding areas.</p>

                        <p>In its first full year of implementation, our new electronic patient record system is already delivering solid benefits. WellStar Connect, our implementation of the Epic® electronic health record software, provides a single source of information shared by all WellStar physician offices, outpatient facilities and hospitals. The system improves care and saves money by avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures. The online portal MyChart uses technology to let patients communicate directly with their doctors. </p>
                        <h3>Cancer Commendation</h3>
                        <p>The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer granted our cancer program a three-year accreditation with commendation, the highest level of achievement recognized by the commission. This prestigious designation is awarded to sites that exceed standard requirements. Our community-based, world-renowned oncologists offer the most advanced treatment available.</p>
                        <h3>We've Got Heart</h3>
                        <p>This year WellStar Kennestone Hospital was honored with Consumer Reports’ highest rating for heart surgery, the only Georgia hospital to receive this distinction. The score was based on four metrics, including survival rates, need for a second operation, best surgical techniques and medications. In fiscal year 2014, WellStar surgeons performed 655 cardiac surgeries, up from 543 the previous year. The WellStar Cardiac Network offers leading-edge care and has been recognized nationally for innovation and outcomes.</p>

                        <p>WellStar is passionate about being an employer of choice and our efforts were recognized widely in 2014. We were proud to be the highest-ranking Georgia business on the FORTUNE 100 Best Companies to Work For® list. WellStar was named a top company for executive women by the National Association of Female Executives. Working Mother magazine acknowledged our family-friendly policies by naming us one of their 100 Best Companies. As well, we were honored by AARP and the Society for Human Resource Management as one of the Best Employers for Workers Over 50.</p>
                        <h3>Extending Our Reach</h3>
                        <p>The Mayo Clinic Care Network collaboration is one of several notable partnerships forged this year. In addition, a joint venture with Piedmont Healthcare created a health insurance plan option that benefits community seniors and WellStar employees. As part of an ongoing relationship with Kennesaw State University, WellStar operates the student health clinics and supports student athletics, including KSU’s new football program. A clinical collaboration between WellStar Urgent Care Centers and select Walgreens Healthcare Clinics provides seamless, quality healthcare in a convenient way.</p>

                        <h3>Transforming Health Through Innovation</h3>
                        <p>This year, the Center for Health Transformation (CHT) fine-tuned its mission—to bring together not-for-profit health systems, universities and technology organizations to develop real-world health solutions through collaboration, research and innovation. A joint research project launched through the Georgia Tech Research Institute seeks ways to offer better care at lower costs. CHT serves as an incubator for promising new solutions to medical challenges here in northwest Georgia and beyond. As a Medicare Accountable Care Organization (ACO), WellStar contributed to a national savings of $370 million this year. ACOs are select providers charged with delivering exceptional, affordable care to Medicare patients. ACO participation requires medical staff to use innovative strategies to cut costs without compromising quality.</p>
                        <h3>A Solid Foundation</h3>
                        <p>While patient revenue lets us maintain high-quality care, it is the support from the communities we serve, through donations to the WellStar Foundation, that enables us to deliver world-class care. This year, contributions from employees, businesses and neighbors neared $5 million. These donations will help provide inpatient hospice care to those in need, fund a comprehensive stroke center, support the new WellStar Paulding Hospital, provide life-saving screenings, community health education and safety programs to those in need, and so much more.</p>

                    <h2>Caring for Those in Need</h2>
                    <p>At WellStar, we are committed to caring for those in need throughout our community. For the past five years, we have provided more than $200 million per year in unreimbursed care. This year, 11 percent of all healthcare provided by WellStar was for those without insurance.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>As the graph/infographic below illustrates, WellStar incurred costs of more than $110 million to provide charity care to patients in Bartow, Cherokee, Cobb, Douglas and Paulding counties in fiscal year 2014. Patients are deemed eligible for charity care, with no obligation to pay, according to state regulations and WellStar policy.
                    <br><br>We also provided an additional $65 million to care for those who for various reasons did not apply for charity care, but were still unable to pay for services. Finally, our physicians and facilities made up a significant shortfall in reimbursements for patients on Medicaid ($25 million) and on Medicare ($98 million).</p>

                        <h2 class="patient-title">Gina Manley's Story<br><span>Meet the Young Woman Who Strong-Armed Cancer</span></h2>
                        <p>In February 2014, Gina Manley was taking a shower when she noticed a growth on her upper left arm. Although the 29-year-old Medicaid analyst had always stayed in shape, she was pretty sure that the enlargement was not a pumped-up bicep.
                        <br><br>Gina’s primary doctor referred her to WellStar general surgeon Dr. Patrick Brannon. A biopsy revealed that Gina had a rare type of cancer known as a synovial sarcoma. “When I heard those words I was speechless,” recalls Gina. “I kept thinking, ‘OK, that’s just not right. Let’s redo this.’”</p>
                        <div class="video-container" onclick="showNotificationArea();">
                            <iframe width="830" height="467" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNBT01ZxWvA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>
                        <p>Gina’s parents were in the room when she received the diagnosis. Gina knew she had to stay strong for her mom and dad. Meanwhile, they were fighting back tears in order to protect their daughter.
                        <br><br>Dr. Brannon recommended that Gina see his colleague, cancer surgeon Dr. Sahir Shroff. “When Dr. Shroff walked into the office he extended his hand and said, ‘Gina, you’re too young for this but everything’s going to be fine. We’re going to get through it.’” His compassionate approach helped put Gina at ease as she struggled with her new reality.</p>
                        <h3>Preparing For the Worst</h3>
                        <p>“Dr. Shroff prepared me for the worst-case scenario, telling me I might end up with significant weakening and a severe deformity in my upper arm.” Gina also learned that prior to surgery she would have to undergo radiation in order to shrink the tumor. During that first meeting Gina told Dr. Shroff there was something else she wanted him to know.
                        <br><br>“I told him I had tickets for the Beyoncé concert on July 15 and really wanted to go.” Dr. Shroff assured Gina he would do everything to try and make it happen.
                        <br><br>On July 8, Dr. Shroff and his team at WellStar Kennestone Hospital operated on Gina. “I came out with minimal scarring and I could use my arm a lot more than I thought. Within a couple of months I was able to lift weights and do push ups!”
                        <br><br>As she regains her busy, active life Gina is exceedingly grateful to the WellStar medical team. “Sure, I would have preferred to never go through this,” she says. “But I’ve grown to accept and appreciate what I’ve been through. It’s been a bumpy ride but I wouldn’t trade it for anything.” 
                        <br><br>And the Beyoncé concert? You bet Gina was there—sling and all!</p>

                        <p>Spend a few minutes with Ross Shafer, 27, and you feel like you’ve known him for years. Ross, a professional bartender from Vinings, has the open, friendly personality typical of those in his profession.
                        <br><br>About seven years ago, Ross purchased a motorcycle and enjoyed commuting on two wheels. “I was always very careful but on an October night in 2011 as I was leaving work I hit a patch of oil and lost control of the bike.” Although the accident occurred at slow speed, Ross fell on his right arm and hand, breaking the tiny scaphoid bone in his wrist.</p>
                        <div class="video-container" onclick="showNotificationArea();">
                            <iframe width="830" height="467" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-prtobC52fM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>
                        <p>Ross visited a surgeon who explained that the bone was very difficult to repair. Surgery would involve inserting a screw to hold the bone together while it healed.
                        <br><br>“I wondered if I should get another opinion,” Ross recalls. “One concern was that a screw in my wrist might could keep me from ever throwing a baseball again." 
                        <br><br>His next stop was the office of WellStar hand surgeon, Dr. Craig Weil. Says Ross, “The minute I walked in, there was a feeling of warmth and welcome. Dr. Weil agreed that surgery was an option, but he also discussed the possibility of letting the broken bone heal on its own.” Although Ross knew that it would not be a quick fix, he liked the idea of letting nature take its course.
                        <br><br>Over the next several months, Ross made great progress and the tiny bone was nearly healed. Unfortunately, that progress was reversed when Ross was involved in an automobile accident caused by a driver who ran a red light. The wrist re-fractured. “At that point, Dr. Weil told me we had to go after this hard so in March 2012, I had my first surgery to set the bone,” says Ross. 
                        <br><br>About 10 months later, Dr. Weil inserted a bone graph to promote healing. Finally, in 2013, he performed a final bone graph and added another screw. 
                        <br><br>It’s been a long haul. But thanks to Dr. Weil’s expertise and Ross’s positive attitude, he is free of pain and is starting to throw a baseball again. Ross adds, “I never expected to achieve this range of motion. I feel better than ever. Dr. Weil was there for me from the beginning to the end.”</p>

                        <p>Kristen and Bryan Larson have shared a lot in 23 years of marriage. But they never imagined that they would share the experience of back surgery.</p>
                        <div class="video-container" onclick="showNotificationArea();">
                            <iframe width="830" height="467" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GX1Z5h4LnNs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>
                     	<p>Their story begins in September 2013 when a lifting injury left Bryan, 49, with severe pain in his arms and numbness in his fingers. An orthopedic physican prescribed medication and physical therapy.
						<br><br>“But it just wasn’t getting better,” Bryan recalls. Further testing indicated two herniated, or bulging disks. Herniation results from the loss of the cushiony, soft center of the disks that make up the spine. Bryan was referred to WellStar spinal surgeon Dr. Ali Mortazavi who confirmed that surgery to remove the damaged disks and fuse the spine was the only option. Bryan was surprised to learn that, left untreated, the problem disks could cause paralysis.
						<br><br>“I can’t say enough good things about Dr. Mortazavi,” says Bryan. “He answered two full pages of my questions, so that I knew exactly what to expect.” On a Wednesday morning in February 2014, Bryan underwent surgery at WellStar Cobb Hospital. He was home by Friday and soon returned to work as a sales representative and even to the gym.</p>
                        <h3>All in the Family</h3>
                        <p>A couple of months after Bryan’s symptoms surfaced, Kristen, a 46-year-old artist, started to experience “a horrible, stabbing pain down my leg.” It got so bad that at times she was forced to crawl up the stairs of the couple’s Marietta home. 
						<br><br>“Because of what I’d seen with Bryan I wanted to cut to the chase and get some answers,” says Kristen. That meant meeting with Dr. Mortazavi who confirmed that damaged lower back disks were pressing on her nerves and causing the leg pain. Dr. Mortazavi also discovered compressed neck disks resulting in serious balance problems. 
						<br><br>“Six weeks to the day after my husband’s operation, I entered Cobb Hospital for my neck surgery,” says Kristen. A second successful surgery was completed to address the back. Today Kristen is feeling great.
						<br><br>Both Larsons were delighted with the care at Cobb Hospital and enormously grateful to Dr. Mortazavi and his team. Echoing Bryan’s feelings, Kristen says, “At the end of the day, the surgery was the greatest thing I’ve ever done for myself.”</p>

                        <p>“I was never really afraid. I knew I’d be alright no matter what happened.” Jesse (“Al”) Gunnels, 64, credits his faith for keeping him calm during a heart attack as he worked at home on a Friday morning in August 2014. And he credits his WellStar Douglas Hospital team for saving his life.
                        <br><br>Al, a Douglasville software entrepreneur, woke up with a slight tightness in his chest. He assumed it was indigestion and didn’t worry much about it. After all, Al was a fit, active person with no family history of heart disease.
                        <br><br>But the discomfort worsened. “The pain and numbness started moving into my shoulders and arm and I broke out into a cold sweat.” Al called his wife Robin who was out shopping and asked her to hurry home. He took a couple of aspirin as the couple headed to the hospital.
                        <br><br>Fast forward to the WellStar Douglas Hospital emergency department where an EKG revealed blocked arteries and a heart attack in progress. “One of the emergency doctors put his hand on my shoulder and told me not to be alarmed. He said there would be lots of people moving around quickly but that I would be fine.” Al needed to hear those reassuring words.</p>

						<br><br>Just 39 minutes elapsed between the Gunnels’ arrival at the hospital and the completion of the procedure. “I felt better immediately; the pain was gone,” Al says. “When I thanked the team they said they were just doing their jobs. “I said, ‘It may be your job, but it’s my life you saved and I appreciate it!’”
						<br><br>Al had nothing but praise for Dr. Mannino and all those who cared for him during his three-day hospital stay. “The nurses genuinely cared about how my wife and I were doing. And they took the time to help me understand the science behind what had happened.”
						<br><br>Today, Al is back to kayaking and running after the grandkids and looks forward to a spring 2015 retirement. “I couldn’t be more pleased with my care and how things have worked out,” he says.</p>

                        <h2>Stroke of Luck and a Second Chance at Life</h2>
                        <p>Ask typical teens what comes to mind when they hear the word stroke and you’ll get answers like “old people,” “dying” or “paralyzed.” Ask 18-year-old John Cothran the same question and you’ll hear the words “miracle” and “second chance.” That’s because the unthinkable happened to John. Two years ago, at age 16, he suffered a major stroke.
                        <br><br>How major? So major that few people imagined this vibrant, athletic Woodstock High School sophomore would see his 17th birthday. </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>“On December 3, 2012, a buddy and I were working out at LA Fitness in Woodstock. My head started hurting really badly so I asked my friend to drive me to WellStar Urgent Care in Towne Lake.” There, Dr. Carlos Garcia recognized the signs of a possible stroke and sent John by ambulance to WellStar Kennestone Hospital. 
						<br><br>Tests confirmed that John had suffered a stroke due to the rupture of a tangle of abnormal blood vessels known as an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). When the pressurized vessels burst, they caused potentially fatal bleeding in John’s brain. 
						<br><br>WellStar neurosurgeon Dr. Ahmad Khaldi performed emergency surgery to remove a piece of his skull to make room for his rapidly swelling brain. John’s mom Carey recalls, “The operating room nurses kept coming out with messages from Dr. Khaldi telling us John was okay.”</p> 
						<img class="no-fade photo-cothran" src="images/photo-cothran.jpg" alt="John Cothran">
                        <p>Over the next four months, John’s condition was fragile as his brain healed enough to permit the AVM to be removed. He suffered constant headaches and required a great deal of rest. After weighing the options, the family decided on surgical removal of the vessels. Although the risk of death was low, the possibility that John would lose his sight was high.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“After more than 10 hours of surgery, Dr. Khaldi came out to tell us he had been successful,” says Carey. But would there be lasting damage to John’s ability to speak, walk and see? No one could know for sure. The next day as John emerged from the sedation, Dr. Khaldi urged him to give a thumbs up. To everyone’s delight John extended his right hand and grabbed Dr. Khaldi’s.
						<br><br>That was the beginning of a painstaking but dramatic recovery. “Dr. Khaldi is truly the smartest person I’ve ever known,” says Carey. “The support and friendship he and the nurses on the ICU floor extended to John and our family were incredible. They never treated him like a helpless victim.” 
						<br><br>John graduated on time with his classmates and is currently a freshman at Kennesaw State University, and a recipient of the HOPE Scholarship. Inspired by his WellStar caregivers, he has set his sights on a career as a physician’s assistant. John acknowledges that he’s regained more than physical abilities. He’s also acquired insight. “In the past I’d never say ‘I love you’ to my mom. Now, anytime I can, I tell her I love her and my family so much.”
						<br><br>Thanks to his friend, John’s own quick thinking, the extraordinary WellStar neuroscience team and the prayers of all who love him, John can anticipate a full and vibrant future. He’ll be the first to tell you that he’s gotten a second chance at life.</p>
